Email from Kindergarten math teacher results in a sleepless night:

    Today we continued to explore odd and even numbers.  After reading the 
    book, Even Steven and Odd Todd, a story about an odd cousin who turns 
    Even Steven's world upside down,students played the Even Steven Odd Todd 
    card game. One student was Even Steven, the other Odd Todd. They took 
    turns to take 2 cards from the pile and add them to find the sum. If they 
    were Even Steven and their sum was even they could keep the cards. If the 
    sum was odd then they needed to discard. The same was true for Odd Todd 
    only visa versa. At a given time the game was stopped and they counted 
    their cards. The winner posted his/her post it note Yellow for even, 
    orange for odd. on the board. Roles were reversed and we played again.

    Coming back together as a group we placed the 2 different colored post it 
    notes into a bar graph. Oddly enough odd won. 
    
    We took a closer look at the patterns:
      odd number +even number= odd number
        3+4=7
      even number +even number =even number
        6+2=8
      odd number +odd number =even number
        3+5=8

    I posed the question, if we were to play the game many times who should win 
    the most Even Steven or Odd Todd? Some understood that there was a greater 
    chance that Even Steven would win!

I assumed the game was played with a deck of playing cards, with jacks, queens, 
kings and jokers removed, and aces counting as one.  Shouldn't the symmetry of
the deck result in equal chances for Even Steven and Odd Todd?

Turns out no!  Odd Todd has the advantage.  The reason is that the players start
their turns by drawing 2 cards.  The first card has an equal chance of being even
or odd, and the second card has a slightly higher chance of being opposite.
